However there is no bar to provide help to other sections of society. To grant financial aid or interest free loans to orphans, widows and poor children, old and infirm persons by way of maintenance, scholarship, books, uniforms, medical aid, clothes, food grains, medicines etc. or in such form as the society may decide. The executive have decided that the society will initially concentrate on proving help to widows and their children who have been left to fend to themselves due to unfortunate death of their husband and bread winner. Latter on we propose to undertake other activities such as providing help to their children to pursue their education, making them financially independent and general counseling. The members of the society according to our constitutions are all working in an honorary capacity and cannot draw any salary or honorarium.
		 The members of the executive committee spend money from their own pocket for meeting even petty expenditure on traveling and petrol, tea etc...</p>
